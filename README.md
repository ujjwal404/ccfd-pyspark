PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. It not only allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs but also provides the PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data in a distributed environment. PySpark is faster than Pandas because of its inbuilt API. The other difference between PySpark and Pandas is former uses Tables and the latter uses DataFrames.
We have used a dataset of fraud cases and trained the ML model using PySpark to detect the fraud using standard preprocessing and training methods. \
We achieved:
* Accuracy of 88.42%
* Recall of 0.8842
* Precision of  0.913

Made by *[@UjjwalKadam](https://github.com/ujjwal404), [@TarushBajaj](https://github.com/Tarushfx)* and *[@Ujjwal](https://github.com/ujjwal2604)* as capstone project-4 for CACSC19 course.
